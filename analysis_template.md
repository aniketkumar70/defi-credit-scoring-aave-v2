## Conclusion

The credit scoring model successfully identifies distinct behavioral patterns across DeFi wallet activities. The analysis reveals three main user segments: new/inactive users (300-400), growing active users (400-799), and institutional/power users (800-1000). The model's exceptional performance (R² = 0.9836) demonstrates strong predictive capability, with transaction timing patterns being the most critical factor in determining creditworthiness.

The extremely high volumes and sophisticated behavior patterns in the highest score range suggest institutional participation in DeFi protocols. The absence of wallets below 300 points indicates that the Aave V2 dataset primarily contains legitimate users rather than high-risk accounts.

This analysis provides a robust foundation for DeFi credit assessment, with clear behavioral segmentation that can inform risk management strategies and user engagement approaches.
